# Installation

Commander can be installed in many ways, here are the current official methods:

### Roblox Marketplace

Commander is published in the Roblox Marketplace, if your game is not built with Rojo, this is the most recommended method to install Commander.

For starters, make sure you have installed the latest version of Roblox Studio. Then retrieve the Commander module at this [page](https://www.roblox.com/library/6648688759/Commander-4)

Once done, just open Toolbox in Roblox Studio, drag the Commander module you just retrieved into the game viewport. For further configuration, refer to the [Configuration](./config) section.

### Rojo

If your game is built with Rojo, syncing Commander into your project may be better than the method above.

Either use the module loader, or copy the whole source code into your project will work, depends on whether will you modify the source code or not.

#### Module loader

#### Source code

Make sure you have installed the latest version of Git, and then open a terminal window (Windows: Windows Terminal/CMD, Mac/GNU+Linux: Terminal)

Clone the repository by using the `git clone` command:
```
git clone https://github.com/7kayoh/commander.git
```

Once done, head into the repository folder with `cd`, and then either drag or copy the `src` folder into your project, change the folder name to `Commander`, whatever floats your boat.

For further configuration, refer to the [Configuration](./config) section.
