# Installing packages
Installing packages are fairly simple, in order to find custom packages created by the community, you can find a list of packages in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RzxxD7YCaU), or via the toolbox inside Studio.

However, depends on how did you install Commander, there are currently two ways to install packages, both has a fairly similar method, but has big changes in some of the steps.

## Installing packages in source-based Commander.
To install a package in a source-based Commander, you can drag the custom package you wish to install into the `Custom` folder of the `Packages` folder. Which is inside your Commander's installation.

If you can not find a folder named `Custom` inside `Packages`, just create a new folder and name it `Custom`, or anything you like.

## Installing packages in require loader
To install a package in a require loader-based Commander, drag the custom package into the `Packages` folder inside the require loader. The require loader will create a folder called `Custom` inside `Packages` once Commander is loaded.
