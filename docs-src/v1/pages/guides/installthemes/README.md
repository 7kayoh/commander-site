Installing themes are fairly simple, in order to find themes created by the community, you can find a list of themes in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RzxxD7YCaU), or via the toolbox inside Studio.

However, depends on how did you install Commander, there are currently two ways to install themes, both has a fairly similar method, but has big changes in some of the steps.

## Installing themes in source-based Commander.
To install a theme in a source-based Commander, you can drag the theme you wish to install into the `Stylesheets` folder of the `UI` folder. Which is inside your Commander's installation.

Once done, just go back to your Settings module, and edit the `Theme` to the name of the theme you wish to use.

## Installing themes in require loader
To install a package in a require loader-based Commander, drag the theme into the `Stylesheets` folder inside the require loader. 

Once done, just go back to your Settings module, and edit the `Theme` to the name of the theme you wish to use.
