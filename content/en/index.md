Commander is an open source administration system solution that is made to eliminate the inefficiency problem with text-based administration system. By providing a panel-like interface for administrators to run commands on, reducing the steps needed to execute a command.

## Commander vs. X

### Adonis
Adonis works great if you have a group roleplay game to moderate. However, the current command bar lacks proper autocomplete to type commands faster and prevent the risk of having a misspell, which can lead to an [*onosecond*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6NJkWbM1xk).

### SimpleAdmin
SimpleAdmin is basically like Basic Admin Essentials, but better in the code quality and its safety. However, SimpleAdmin lacks the option to customize theme with modules. Users who want to customize SimpleAdmin need to directly edit the components. Also, user can not switch to the theme they want, everyone is locked to the same theme.

### Basic Admin Essentials
I (7kayoh) originally created Commander as an alternative to Basic Admin Essentials. Not because of the looks, but because of the code in Basic Admin Essentials.

BAE (Basic Admin Essentials in short), lacks proper documentation, active maintainers, typechecks, and a lot more. There are a lot of security concerns where BAE can potentially be exploited to cause performance degrades in a server.

It is best not to use Basic Admin Essentials given the above, unless you plan to fix the flaws yourself.
