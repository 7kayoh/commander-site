# Commander
Commander is an advanced open-sourced **free** administration panel made for the Roblox community. With just 4 easy steps, you can start using the best administration panel for your game today!

# Our Story
Commander started back in 2019 as a fun project, but has progressed into more, to where we are today.

# Get Started
You do not need knowledge of programming in order to set up Commander, we will walk you through it all! (Although knowing some is helpful!)

You can install Commander by clicking [this link](https://github.com/va1kio/commander/blob/main/Commander.rbxm), or by visiting the [Developer Forum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/dp1-commander-your-next-admin-system/503290), hosted by Roblox.

Once downloaded, open a game in Roblox Studio.

!> API Services must be enabled for Commander to work correctly!

To turn on API services go to the `Home` tab and click on `Game Settings` and find `Security` and enable `API Services`!

After that, go to the `View` tab and click on `Explorer` and `Command Bar`.

Right click on your `Explorer` and press `Insert from File`.

Locate your `Commander.RBXM` file.

Once Commander is inserted your Explorer should look like this,

Locate your `Command Bar` located at the bottom of you screen. Insert this codeblock into it and press `Enter`.

```lua
workspace.Commander.Server.Disabled = false
workspace.Commander.Server.Parent = game:GetService("ServerScriptService")
workspace.Commander:Destroy()
```

Once completed, your `Explorer` should look like this,

And finally, you can configure the **administrator list** by going to `ServerScriptService > SystemPackages > Settings`

You should find a table, or something that looks like this!

To add administrators simply follow this format,

```lua
["Admins"] = {
	[game.CreatorId] = "Owner",
	["nana_kon"] = "Owner",
	["USERNAME"] = "ADMINLEVEL",
},
```

There are three types of administrator levels built-in, which is:

- Owner
- Admin
- Moderator

To set a specific user to a corresponding administrator level, simply change the string after the Username/UserId to the level's name, like this:

```lua
["Admins"] = {
  ["nana_kon"] = "Moderator"
}
```

!> Using Commander in a group game? Be sure to remove the entry with `[game.CreatorId]`.

Congratulations! You've set up and configured Commander. If you want to setup group rank, read the article below.

# Adding group rank to Commander

Since Developer Preview 2 (A1150), we've added support for group-based permission, so you can set a specific group rank to be able to use Commander, here's a brief example of how:

```lua
["Admins"] = {
  ["12312312:50"] = "Owner"
}
```

In the example above, Commander will automatically set all users who is in the group with Id `12312312` and with rank `50` to Owner.

Of course, we've also added support for `greater than or equal to` and `lesser than or equal to`for group ranks. Here's how:

```lua
["Admins"] = {
  ["12312312:>50"] = "Owner",
  ["12312312:<49"] = "Moderator",
}
```

The example above will tell Commander to automatically set all users who is in the group and with rank equal to or greater than 50 to Owner. Meanwhile will also set all users who is in the group but with rank equal to or lesser than 40 to Moderator.
